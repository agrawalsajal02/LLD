        // how many dice

//        Design Patterns Involved:
//        https://lldcoding.com/design-lld-snake-and-ladder-game-machine-coding-1
//        Singleton Pattern: Used for creating a single instance of the board to ensure that all players interact with the same board.
//
//                Factory Pattern: Used to create snakes and ladders on the board.
//
//                Observer Pattern: Used to notify players about their turns.
//
//                Strategy Pattern: Used to define the dice rolling strategy, which can be changed dynamically.
//
//        Command Pattern: Used to encapsulate a request as an object to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations


//        Issues in the Above Design (Covered in our premium course)
//        Single-threaded Design:
//
//        Issue: The current design is single-threaded, which may not be suitable for real-time multiplayer games.
//
//        Resolution: Introduce multithreading to handle simultaneous player actions and improve performance.
//
//        Scalability Issues:
//
//        Issue: The design may not scale well with a large number of players or an extensive board size.
//
//                Resolution: Optimize data structures and algorithms to handle larger scales efficiently.
//
//        No Separation of Concerns:
//
//        Issue: The design mixes game logic, user notifications, and command execution.
//
//        Resolution: Refactor the code to separate these concerns, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
//
//                Limited Extensibility:
//
//        Issue: Adding new features or modifying existing ones may require significant code changes.
//                Performance Bottlenecks:
//
//        Issue: Random number generation and frequent lookups in maps may cause performance issues.
//
//        Resolution: Optimize these operations and consider more efficient data structures if necessary.
//
//                Extensions of the Design
//        Customizable Board:
//
//        Description: Allow users to create and play on custom boards.
//
//                Implementation: Implement a configuration file or a GUI-based board editor where users can define the board size, and the positions of snakes and ladders. - Covered in ourpremium course.
//
//                **Support Multi-Board -Covered in ourpremium course.
//
//                Save and Load Game State:
//
//        Description: Provide functionality to save and load the game's state.
//
//        Implementation: Covered in ourpremium course.
//
//        AI Players:
//
//        Description: Introduce computer-controlled players with varying difficulty levels.
//
//                Implementation: Implement AI strategies for making moves and integrate them into the game logic. Allow users to choose between human and AI players - Covered in ourpremium course.
//
//                Different Dice Types:
//
//        Description: Offer various types of dice with different numbers of faces.
//
//        Implementation: Modify the DiceStrategy to include different dice types. Allow players to select their preferred dice type before starting the game - Covered in ourpremium course.
//
//                Enhanced Game Rules:
//
//        Description: Add optional and customizable game rules.
//
//        Implementation: Implement additional rules such as extra turns for rolling doubles or penalties for specific squares. Allow players to configure these rules at the start of the game - Covered in ourpremium course.
//
//                Player Statistics and Leaderboards:
//
//        Description: Track player performance and maintain leaderboards.
//
//        Implementation: Store player statistics such as wins, losses, and total games played. Display leaderboards showing top players based on these statistics - Covered in ourpremium course.
